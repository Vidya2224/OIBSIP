    <h1>Charles Babbage</h1>

 <section class="about_section">
    <p><b>Charles Babbage</b>( 26 December 1791 – 18 October 1871) was an English polymath.[1] A mathematician, philosopher, 
        inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer
        Babbage is considered by some to be "father of the computer". Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical 
        computer, the Difference Engine, that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of modern 
        computers are to be found in Babbage's Analytical Engine, programmed using a principle openly borrowed from the Jacquard loom.
        Babbage had a broad range of interests in addition to his work on computers covered in his book Economy of Manufactures and Machinery.
        His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as "pre-eminent" among the many polymaths of his century.
        Babbage, who died before the complete successful engineering of many of his designs, including his Difference Engine and Analytical 
        Engine, remained a prominent figure in the ideating of computing. Parts of Babbage's incomplete mechanisms are on display in the 
        Science Museum in London. In 1991, a functioning difference engine was constructed from Babbage's original plans.
         Built to tolerances achievable in the 19th century, the success of the finished engine indicated that Babbage's machine would have 
         worked.</p>

 <section class="about1">
    <h2>At the University of Cambridge</h2><br>
    <p>Babbage arrived at Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1810. He was already self-taught in some parts of contemporary mathematics;
       he had read Robert Woodhouse, Joseph Louis Lagrange, and Marie Agnesi. As a result, he was disappointed in the standard mathematical
       instruction available at the university.Babbage, John Herschel, George Peacock, and several other friends formed the Analytical Society in 
       1812; they were also close to Edward Ryan.[20] As a student, Babbage was also a member of other societies such as The Ghost Club, concerned
       with investigating supernatural phenomena, and the Extractors Club, dedicated to liberating its members from the madhouse, should any be 
       committed to one.In 1812, Babbage transferred to Peterhouse, Cambridge.[18] He was the top mathematician there, but did not graduate with 
       honours. He instead received a degree without examination in 1814. He had defended a thesis that was considered blasphemous in 
       the preliminary public disputation, but it is not known whether this fact is related to his not sitting the examination.</p>

    <h2>After Cambridge</h2><br>
    <p> Considering his reputation, Babbage quickly made progress. He lectured to the Royal Institution on astronomy in 1815, and was elected a 
        Fellow of the Royal Society in 1816.[23] After graduation, on the other hand, he applied for positions unsuccessfully, and had little in 
        the way of a career. In 1816 he was a candidate for a teaching job at Haileybury College; he had recommendations from James Ivory and John
        Playfair, but lost out to Henry Walter.[24] In 1819, Babbage and Herschel visited Paris and the Society of Arcueil, meeting leading French
         mathematicians and physicists.[25] That year Babbage applied to be professor at the University of Edinburgh, with the recommendation of 
         Pierre Simon Laplace; the post went to William Wallace.With Herschel, Babbage worked on the electrodynamics of Arago's rotations, 
         publishing in 1825. Their explanations were only transitional, being picked up and broadened by Michael Faraday. The phenomena are 
         now part of the theory of eddy currents, and Babbage and Herschel missed some of the clues to unification of electromagnetic theory,
          staying close to Ampère's force law</p>

    <h2>Academic</h2><br>
    <p>From 1828 to 1839, Babbage was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge. Not a conventional resident don, and inattentive to
       his teaching responsibilities, he wrote three topical books during this period of his life. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member 
       of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832.[50] Babbage was out of sympathy with colleagues: George Biddell Airy,
       his predecessor as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge,[51] thought an issue should be made of his
       lack of interest in lecturing. Babbage planned to lecture in 1831 on political economy. Babbage's reforming direction looked to see 
       university education more inclusive, universities doing more for research, a broader syllabus and more interest in applications; 
       but William Whewell found the programme unacceptable. A controversy Babbage had with Richard Jones lasted for six years.[52] He never 
       did give a lecture</p>

    <h2>Family</h2><br>
    <p>On 25 July 1814, Babbage married Georgiana Whitmore, sister of British parliamentarian William Wolryche-Whitmore, at St. Michael's 
       Church in Teignmouth, Devon.[20] The couple lived at Dudmaston Hall,[182] Shropshire (where Babbage engineered the central heating 
       system), before moving to 5 Devonshire Street, London in 1815.[183]

       Charles and Georgiana had eight children,[184] but only four – Benjamin Herschel, Georgiana Whitmore, Dugald Bromhead and 
       Henry Prevost – survived childhood. Charles' wife Georgiana died in Worcester on 1 September 1827, the same year as his father, 
       their second son (also named Charles) and their newborn son Alexander.

    <h2>Death</h2><br>
    <p>Babbage lived and worked for over 40 years at 1 Dorset Street, Marylebone, where he died, at the age of 79, on 18 October 1871;
       he was buried in London's Kensal Green Cemetery. According to Horsley, Babbage died "of renal inadequacy, secondary to cystitis.
       He had declined both a knighthood[failed verification] and baronetcy. He also argued against hereditary peerages, favouring life 
       peerages instead</p>
